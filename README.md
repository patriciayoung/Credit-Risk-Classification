# Credit-Risk-Classification

# Analysis Overview:
The objective of this analysis was to employ machine learning techniques for credit risk prediction in lending, specifically focusing on identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers. By scrutinizing financial data, our aim was to forecast the probability of loan default. Through the exploration of various training methodologies, we conducted a comparative analysis to ascertain the superior model. The pivotal variable in our analysis was loan_status, where 0 denoted a healthy loan and 1 indicated a high-risk loan. Our analysis encompassed the following stages:

Data ingestion and preparation for modeling.
Segregation of data into training and testing datasets.
Implementation of logistic regression to forecast loan status.
Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Summary:
The logistic regression model exhibits outstanding performance, especially in discerning healthy loans, as evidenced by a flawless F1-score. Although its efficacy in predicting high-risk loans is commendable, there exists room for enhancement, notably in precision. With its elevated overall accuracy and robust recall for high-risk loans, I endorse the utilization of this model by the company. Accurate prediction of high-risk loans holds paramount importance for a lending institution, and the model's high recall score suggests its adeptness in identifying a significant portion of such loans, crucial for mitigating credit risk.
